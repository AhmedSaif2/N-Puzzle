# N-Puzzle Solver
## Description
The N-Puzzle Solver is a C++ application developed using Visual Studio 2022 that solves the classic sliding puzzle game. The solver uses the A* algorithm to find the optimal solution and determine whether the puzzle is solvable. It provides the number of moves required and the sequence of steps to solve the puzzle.

## Features
- **Solvability Check:** Determines if the given puzzle configuration is solvable.
- **Optimal Solution:** Uses the A* algorithm to find the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle.
- **Detailed Output:** Displays the number of moves and the sequence of steps taken to reach the solved state.
## Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
   ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/AhmedSaif2/n-puzzle-solver.git
    ```
2. **Open the Project**:
   - Open Visual Studio 2022.
   - Go to `File` > `Open` > `Project/Solution` and select the `.sln` file in the cloned repository.

3. **Build and Run**:
   - Build the project by selecting `Build` > `Build Solution`.
   - Run the application by pressing `F5` or selecting `Debug` > `Start Debugging`.

## Usage

1. **Input Configuration**:
   - Provide the size and the initial configuration of the puzzle (e.g., a 3x3 grid) as a file inside the N-puzzle folder.

2. **Run the Solver**:
   - The application will process the input and use the A* algorithm to find the solution.

3. **View Output**:
   - The output will include the number of moves required and the sequence of steps to solve the puzzle.
